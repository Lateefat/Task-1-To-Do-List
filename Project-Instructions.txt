Instruction:
You are to develop a To-Do List. Just try your best to design as close to the 
sample as possible. Ask questions too when in doubt.
You should add features like add, delete, onclick to highlight items green. You can add your own concepts too 
so long as it works similar.
Design both the mobile and desktop views so it can be responsive on phone.
